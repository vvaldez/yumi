YUMI
====
A fork of PenDriveLinux.com's YUMI (Your Universal Multiboot Installer): http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/

My goal with this fork is to add additional items such as Windows Defender Offline (accepted in version 0.0.8.9), Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and anything else and hopefully get these sent upstream to the developer.
